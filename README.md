# Templater (WIP)

This Chrome Extension will allow Product Owners to populate Jira issues with a templated description of their choice.

Have you ever had to add multiple Jira issues and wished that there was an easier way to add the description, rather than having to copy and paste the "Given, When, Then" manually? This extension aims to alleviate that frustration.

### Note:
This is simply the code copied from the Google Chrome Extension tutorial.
